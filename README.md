# Cita: a Wikidata addon for Zotero

A [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) plugin adding citation metadata support, with back and forth communication to
[WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/), citation extraction from file attachments, and local citation network visualization.

> **Note:** until [#247](https://github.com/diegodlh/zotero-cita/issues/247) is fixed please change your language setting in Zotero (Edit -> Preference -> Advanced -> Miscellaneous) from `English` to a variant (such as `English (UK)` or `English (Canada)`) for Cita to work correctly!

Initial development of this plugin was supported by a [grant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikicite/grant/WikiCite_addon_for_Zotero_with_citation_graph_support)
from the Wikimedia Foundation.

## Description

The plugin consists of four separate basic modules:

#### Citation metadata support

This module adds citation metadata support to Zotero.
It provides an additional Citations tab where the user can:

-   add, edit or remove individual citations;
-   run item-wide and citation specific actions, such as syncing citations with WikiData, parsing citations from attachments (not yet supported), etc;
-   edit source item's UUIDs, such as DOI, WikiData's QID, and [OpenCitations Corpus](https://opencitations.net/corpus) ID.

Citations metadata are currently saved as a note attachment.

#### WikiData communication

This module provides back and forth citation syncing with WikiData, using property
[P2860](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2860) "cites work".

#### Local Citation Network visualization

This module allows visualizing how items in a local library connect to each other through citations,
using Tim Wölfle's [Local Citation Network](https://timwoelfle.github.io/Local-Citation-Network/).

#### Citation extraction (to be developed)

This module will send file attachments to local or remote citation extraction services
(e.g., [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid), [Scholarcy](http://ref.scholarcy.com/api/)) and
retrieve parsed citations from them.

## Installation

Download the [latest XPI](https://github.com/diegodlh/zotero-cita/releases/latest) and [install](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins) it in Zotero.

## Quickstart guide

Quickstart guide available at [Wikidata's Cita page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Zotero/Cita).

## Development

1. Clone the source code, and run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch the nested submodules.
2. Run `npm install`
3. This plugin is built using Webpack and Babel. Run `npm run build`, or `npm run watch` to rebuild
   automatically each time the source code is changed. Built files will be saved to `dist/chrome/content`.
4. Follow the steps [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/plugin_development#setting_up_a_plugin_development_environment)
   to have Zotero run the plugin directly from the `dist` directory.
5. Start Zotero with these recommended flags:
    - `-p <Profile>`: runs Zotero with a custom development profile to avoid breaking your personal library
    - `-purgecaches`: forces Zotero to re-read any cached files
    - `-ZoteroDebugText`: prints the debug output to the terminal window
    - `-jsconsole`: opens a basic JavaScript debug console; this is not necessary if you be debugging
      using your browser (see below), but it may help you detect early errors without having to open
      the developer tools
6. For distribution, pack the contents of the `dist` directory into a ZIP file and change its extension to `.xpi`.

## Publishing

1. Decide new version number vX.Y.Z using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
2. Update version number in:
   - `/package.json`
   - `/static/install.rdf`
     - **Note:** Choose the correct update script in `em:updateURL` depending on beta/full release
3. Update `version` and `updateLink`s in `/update.rdf` or `./update-beta.rdf` (for the beta release).
4. Run `git clean -xdf` to remove untracked files, including `/dist` and `/node_modules`.
5. Run `npm install`. This will also update `/package-lock.json` with the new version.
6. Run `npm run build` to build the plugin.
7. Zip the contents of `/dist` into a zip file named `zotero-cita-vX.Y.Z.xpi`. E. g. `cd dist && zip -r ../zotero-cita-v0.0.1.xpi *`
8. Until integration tests have been implemented (#30), install the new version
on a fresh Zotero profile and run some manual tests.
1. Run `git commit -m "Bump vX.Y.Z"` and `git push`.
2.  Run `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `git push --tags`.
3.  On GitHub, create a new release:
    1.  Choose tag vX.Y.Z.
    2.  Set release title "vX.Y.Z".
    3.  In the description, list changes since last release.
    4.  Attach the xpi file created above.
    5.  Click "Publish release" and hope everything is alright.

### Debugging

To debug, you need to build Zotero with debugging support. Follow the instructions
[here](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/building_the_standalone_client) to:

1. Clone Zotero source code and scripts.
2. Build the Zotero client. See [1] below
3. Build the Zotero standalone client with the `-t` option.
4. Run Zotero with the `-debugger` flag: `staging/Zotero_linux-x86_64/zotero -debugger ...`. This runs the Mozilla DevTools server
   on port 6100, which you can connect to from Firefox Developer Tools.
5. Download and use a Firefox version compatible with the Firefox version used by Zotero. For example, Zotero 5.0.94
   is based on [Firefox 60.9.0esr](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/60.9.0esr/). See [2] below
6. Run the Firefox version you downloaded using the `--new-instance` flag in case you have another Firefox
   instance running, and the `-p <Profile>` flag to use a separate profile for this version.
7. Open Firefox Developer Tools and connect to port 6100 for remote debugging. See [3] below

[1] Before building, making these changes to the Zotero source code might help you with debugging:

-   If your browser developer tools are failing to retrieve the source maps for the compiled Zotero files,
    try using inline source maps instead. To do this, add a `sourceMaps: "inline"` key:value pair to the `.babelrc`
    configuration file.
-   Zotero has a notification system such that observers can be registered to be notified when certain
    events occur, such as when an item is modified. However, this notification system is [not thoroughly
    documented](https://github.com/zotero/zotero/issues/1310). To log a message to the Zotero debug output each time
    a notification is triggered, uncomment the two calls to `Zotero.debug()` that you will find in the
    `Zotero.Notifier.trigger` function inside `chrome/content/zotero/xpcom/notifier.js`. Make sure you are running
    Zotero with the `-ZoteroDebugText` flag (see previous section).

[2] To prevent your downloaded Firefox version from upgrading to a newer version, you
have to disable automatic updates:

1. Run your system's Firefox version from the command line with the `-P` flag to open the Profile Manager.
2. Create a new profile that you will use with the Firefox version you downloaded.
3. Click on 'Start Firefox' to start your system Firefox using the profile you have just created.
4. Go to `about:config` and set `app.udpate.auto` to `false`.
5. Close your system Firefox.
6. Run the Firefox version you downloaded using the `-P <ProfileName>` flag.

The reason why the setting must be changed using your system Firefox is because it seems that Firefox
checks for updates on startup, before one can change the setting. And if an update is found,
it will be applied on next start, irrespective of this setting's value, overwriting the version you
downloaded.

[3] Unfortunately the developer tools are closed automatically when the Zotero client is closed. Therefore,
each time a change is made to the plugin, the Zotero client must be restarted, and the developer tools
have to be opened again. If someone knows of a way to prevent developer tools from closing and reconnect
when connection is available again, or to have them open automatically via console, so it can be run
immediately after Zotero, please let me know!

It has been [suggested](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/comment/345799/#Comment_345799) that new
Zotero plugins be written as
[bootstrapped extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Add-ons/How_to_convert_an_overlay_extension_to_restartless)
rather than XUL overlay extensions, to facilitate them being ported to a future non-Mozilla version of Zotero.
As [suggested](https://groups.google.com/g/zotero-dev/c/wLZdrPiaKeA/m/PVgi8S93CgAJ) elsewhere, Will Shanks'
[Zutilo plugin](https://github.com/willsALMANJ/Zutilo) was used as an example of an existing bootstrapped
extension to write some parts of this plugin.

Doing anything new in XUL has also been strongly recommended against, and using standard React/HTML has been
suggested instead (see [here](https://groups.google.com/g/zotero-dev/c/xYC0I8JaUAI/m/K6utpEnjCgAJ),
or [here](https://groups.google.com/g/zotero-dev/c/jxD_1mO1jUY/m/OYSw77LVAAAJ)). For these cases,
some inspiration has been borrowed from already reactified components in
[Zotero's source code](https://github.com/zotero/zotero/tree/master/chrome/content/zotero/components).
